        <p>There should be no one who is unaware of the coronavirus, or COVID-19, at this point.
        <br>The coronavirus is a virus that began in China, made its way to the United States, 
        <br>and by January 2020 had spread all over the globe. Shortness of breath, chills, sore throat,
        <br>headache, loss of taste and smell, runny nose, vomiting, and nausea are some of the most
        <br>typical symptoms of the virus. The symptoms may take up to 14 days to manifest, as previously stated.
        <br>Furthermore, because the virus is very infectious, it poses a risk to people of all ages.</p>

        <p>It's a difficult time to be an academic, even if many of us are taking online classes
        <br>and doing our best to aid our students. Our institution offers a dedicated online portal
        <br>via which we may participate in online classes. It is completely safe and secure. 
        <br>It's an engaging session since the students can hear and see us, and we can hear and see them.
        <br>With our pupils, we may share files and displays. Their homework, projects, and tests are all
        <br>completed online. It's a fantastic tool!</p>

        <p>We had been utilising this gateway prior to the COVID-19 epidemic, which made the move to using
        <br>it heavily during the lockdown go well. In metropolitan locations, internet access is rarely an issue,
        <br>but students in mountainous and rural areas have difficulty with this form of instruction.
        <br>COVID-19 has revolutionised the way children throughout the world are educated in only a few weeks.
        <br>These shifts provide a look into how education may evolve in the future. New educational alternatives
        <br>might spark much-needed innovation. Given the digital divide, new educational techniques may worsen disparities.</p>
