            <div class="text"> <br>Taufiq Daniel is my name. I am a Diploma Information Management student at the UiTM Rembau. 
                <br>Everyone can agree that I am an excellent student and a kind individual.
                <br>IMD311 (Introduction to Web Content) is one of my favourite classes.
            
                <p>I consider myself to be a responsible and hardworking student. Furthermore, as a gregarious person, 
                    <br>I have a large number of friends since I enjoy interacting with others and learning about new people.
                    <br>I appreciate my time at university; it is a great place to learn, and the classmates are always willing to help. 
                    <br>I can't help but want to return because of the vibe. I enjoy receiving and completing difficult projects.
                    <br>I am a highly eager learner, and I believe this is one of my strongest qualities.

                <p>My friends describe me as a humorous and fascinating young man with a good sense of humour. 
                    <br>When I meet new people who are excited to meet me, I immediately feel at ease with them.
                    <br>Friendship is, in my opinion, one of the most important virtues in human life. 
                    <br>We exchange fresh ideas, learn new things about each other, and have new experiences. I value friendship and the people in my life.

                <p>It gives me a lot of enthusiasm to meet new people who encourage all of my efforts to grow and 
                    <br>enhance my talents not only in the courses but also in my interests. Many of my current acquaintances
                    <br>I met on the street while engaging in my hobby. I'm a huge sports fan, so what I already enjoy doing 
                    <br>has become even more pleasant. I chose to interact with others through participating in a variety of 
                    <br>sports, such as football, frisbee, and others, in order to enjoy doing what I enjoy. I'm ecstatic to see how
                    <br>happy I am when I'm playing sports.
                
                <p>The goal I'm working toward right now is to make the world a better place to live by starting with myself.
                    <br>Sure, I've had bad luck in my life, but that's exactly what has shaped me into the person I am now: 
                    <br>appreciative, loving, and eager to study hard in the hopes of becoming a successful person with a great
                    <br>quality of life in the future. I suppose it is becoming more apparent day by day, and I am taking
                    <br>on a greater sense of responsibility for what I do and where I go. With what I already have, I know I'm
                    <br>on the right track, and I'll do everything I can to encourage others to live their lives the way they want.
